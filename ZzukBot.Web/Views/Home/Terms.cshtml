    <h2>@ViewData["Title"]</h2>

    <p>This ZzukBot Online Subscription Agreement is between the entity you represent, or, if you do not designate an entity in connection with a Subscription purchase or renewal, you individually ("you" or "your"), and ZzukBot Corporation ("ZzukBot", "we", "us", or "our"). It consists of the terms and conditions below, as well as the Online Services Terms, the SLAs, and the Offer Details for your Subscription or renewal (together, the "agreement"). It is effective on the date we provide you with confirmation of your Subscription or the date on which your Subscription is renewed, as applicable. Key terms are defined in Section&nbsp;8.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of Online Services.</h2>

    <p><strong>a. Right to use.</strong> We grant you the right to access and use the Online Services and to install and use the Software included with your Subscription, as further described in this agreement. We reserve all other rights.</p>
    <p><strong>b. Acceptable use.</strong> You may use the Product only in accordance with this agreement. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or work around technical limitations in the Product,except to the extent applicable law permits it despite these limitations. You may not disable, tamper with, or otherwise attempt to circumvent any billing mechanism that meters your use of the Online Services. You may not rent, lease, lend, resell, transfer, or host the Product, or any portion thereof, to or for thirdparties except as expressly permitted in this agreement or the Online Services Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>c. End Users.</strong> You control access by End Users, and you are responsible for their use of the Product in accordance with this agreement. For example, you will ensure End Users comply with the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>d. Customer Data.</strong> You are solely responsible for the content of all Customer Data. You will secure and maintain all rights in Customer Data necessary for us to provide the Online Services to you without violating the rights of any third party or otherwise obligating ZzukBot to you or to any third party. ZzukBot does not and will not assume any obligations with respect to Customer Data or to your use of the Product other than as expressly set forth in this agreement or as required by applicable law.</p>
    <p><strong>e. Responsibility for your accounts.</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any non-public authentication credentials associated with your use of the Online Services. You must promptly notify our customer support team about any possible misuse of your accounts or authentication credentials or any security incident related to the Online Services.</p>
    <p><strong>f. Preview releases.</strong> Previews are provided "as-is," "with all faults," and "as-available," and are excluded from the SLAs and all limited warranties provided in this agreement. Previews may not be covered by customer support. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into general availability.</p>
    <p><strong>g. Managed Services for ZzukBot Azure.</strong> You may use ZzukBot to provide a Managed Service Solution provided (1)&nbsp;you have the sole ability to access, configure, and administer the ZzukBot, (2)&nbsp;you have administrative access to the virtual OSE(s), if any, in the Managed Service Solution, and (3)&nbsp;the third party has administrative access only to its application(s) or virtual OSE(s). You are responsible for the third party's use of ZzukBot in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Your provision of Managed Services remains subject to the following limitations (and any other limitations in the Online Services Terms)</p>
    <p><strong>(i)</strong> you may not resell or redistribute the ZzukBot, and</p>
    <p><strong>(ii)</strong> you may not allow multiple users to directly or indirectly access any ZzukBot feature that is made available on a per-user basis.</p>
    <p><strong>h. Administrator Assumption of Control.</strong> If you use an email address provided by an organization you are affiliated with (e.g. an employer or school) to order an Online Service individually, you represent that you have authority to use that organization's domain to sign up for a Subscription in your capacity as a member of that organization. The organization, as the owner of the domain associated with your email address, may assume control over and manage your use of the Online Services. In such a case, your organization's designated administrator (your "admin") may (i) control and administer your account, including modifying and terminating your access and (ii) access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. ZzukBot may inform you that your organization has assumed control of the Online Services covered by your Subscription, but ZzukBot is under no obligation to provide such notice. If your organization is administering your use of the Online Services or managing the tenant associated with your Subscription, direct your data subject requests and privacy inquiries to your administrator. If your organization is not administering your use of the Online Service or managing such tenant, direct your data subject requests and privacy inquiries to ZzukBot.</p>
    <p><strong>i. Shared Directory Data.</strong> When you order an Online Service using an email address with a domain provided by an organization you are affiliated with (e.g. an employer or school), the Online Service adds you to a directory of users that share the same email domain. Your directory data (name, date of signup, and email address) may be visible to other users of Online Services within your organization's email domain.</p>
    <p><strong>j. Additional Software for use with the Online Services.</strong> To enable optimal access to and use of certain Online Services, you may install and use certain Software in connection with your use of the Online Service as described in the Online Services Terms. We license Software to you; we do not sell it. Proof of your Software license is (1)&nbsp;this agreement, (2)&nbsp;any order confirmation, and (3)&nbsp;proof of payment. Your rights to access Software on any device do not give you any right to implement ZzukBot patents or other ZzukBot intellectual property in software or devices that access that device.</p>

    <h2>2. Purchasing services.</h2>

    <p><strong>a. Available Subscription offers.</strong> The Portal provides Offer Details for available Subscription offers, which generally can be categorized as one or a combination of the following:</p>
    <p><strong>(i) Commitment Offering.</strong> You commit in advance to purchase a specific quantity of Online Services for use during a Term and to pay upfront or on a periodic basis in advance of use. With respect to ZzukBot, additional or other usage (for example, usage beyond your commitment quantity) may be treated as a Consumption Offering. Committed quantities not used during the Term will expire at the end of the Term.</p>
    <p><strong>(ii) Consumption Offering (also called Pay-As-You-Go).</strong> You pay based on actual usage in the preceding month with no upfront commitment. Payment is on a periodic basis in arrears.</p>
    <p><strong>(iii) Limited Offering.</strong> You receive a limited quantity of Online Services for a limited term without charge (for example, as a trial Subscription or free account) or as part of another ZzukBot offering (for example, MSDN). Provisions in this agreement with respect to pricing, cancellation fees, payment, and data retention may not apply.</p>
    <p><strong>b. Ordering.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>(i)</strong> By ordering or renewing a Subscription, you agree to the Offer Details for that Subscription. Unless otherwise specified in those Offer Details, Online Services are offered on an "as available" basis. You may place orders for your Affiliates under this agreement and grant your Affiliates administrative rights to manage the Subscription, but Affiliates may not place orders under this agreement. You also may assign the rights granted under Section 1.a. to a third party for use by that third party in your internal business. If you grant any rights to Affiliates or third parties with respect to Software or your Subscription, such Affiliates or third parties will be bound by this agreement and you agree to be jointly and severally liable for any actions of such Affiliates or third parties related to their use of the Products.</p>
    <p><strong>(ii)</strong> Some offers may permit you to modify the quantity of Online Services ordered during the Term of a Subscription. Additional quantities of Online Services added to a Subscription will expire at the end of that Subscription. If you decrease the quantity during a Term, we may charge you a cancellation fee for the decrease in quantity as described below in Section 3.b.</p>
    <p><strong>c. Pricing and payment.</strong> Payments are due and must be made according to the Offer Details for your Subscription.</p>
    <p><strong>(i)</strong> For Commitment Offerings, the price level may be based on the quantity of Online Services you ordered. Some offers may permit you to modify the quantity of Online Services ordered during the Term and your price level may be adjusted accordingly, but price level changes will not be retroactive. During the Term of your Subscription, prices for Online Services will not be increased, as to your Subscription, from those posted in the Portal at the time your Subscription became effective or was renewed, except where prices are identified as temporary in the Offer Details, or for Previews or Non-ZzukBot Products. All prices are subject to change at the beginning of any Subscription renewal.</p>
    <p><strong>(ii)</strong> For Consumption Offerings, pricing is subject to change at any time upon notice.</p>
    <p><strong>d. Renewal</strong></p>
    <p><strong>(i)</strong> Upon renewal of your Subscription, this agreement will terminate, and your Subscription will thereafter be governed, by the terms and conditions set forth in the Portal on the date on which your Subscription is renewed (the "Renewal Terms"). If you do not agree to any Renewal Terms, you may decline to renew your Subscription.</p>
    <p><strong>(ii)</strong> For Commitment Offerings, you may choose to have a Subscription automatically renew or terminate upon expiration of the Term. Automatic renewal is pre-selected. You can change your selection at any time during the Term. If the existing Term is longer than one calendar month, we will provide you with notice of the automatic renewal before the expiration of the Term.</p>
    <p><strong>(iii)</strong> For Consumption Offerings, your Subscription will renew automatically for additional one-month terms until you terminate the Subscription.</p>
    <p><strong>(iv)</strong> For Limited Offerings, renewal may not be permitted.</p>
    <p><strong>e. Eligibility for Academic, Government and Nonprofit versions.</strong> You agree that if you are purchasing an academic, government or nonprofit offer, you meet the respective eligibility requirements listed at the following sites:</p>
    <p>ZzukBot reserves the right to verify eligibility at any time and suspend the Online Service if the eligibility requirements are not met.</p>
    <p><strong>f. Taxes.</strong> Prices are exclusive of any taxes unless otherwise specified on the invoice as tax inclusive. You must pay any applicable value added, goods and services, sales, gross receipts, or other transaction taxes, fees, charges or surcharges, or any regulatory cost recovery surcharges or similar amounts that are owed under this agreement and which we are permitted to collect from you under applicable law. You will be responsible for any applicable stamp taxes and for all other taxes that you are legally obligated to pay including any taxes that arise on the distribution or provision of Products to your Affiliates. We will be responsible for all taxes based on our net income, gross receipts taxes imposed in lieu of taxes on income or profits, or taxes on our property ownership.</p>
    <p>If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments you make to us, you may deduct such taxes from the amount owed to us and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority; provided, however, that you promptly secure and deliver an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents we reasonably request to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. You must ensure that any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>3. Term, termination, and suspension.</h2>

    <p><strong>a. Agreement term and termination.</strong> This agreement will remain in effect until the expiration, termination, or renewal of your Subscription, whichever is earliest.</p>
    <p><strong>b. Subscription termination.</strong> You may terminate a Subscription at any time during its Term; however, you must pay all amounts due and owing before the termination is effective.</p>
    <p><strong>(i) One-Month Subscription.</strong> A Subscription having a one-month Term may be terminated anytime without any cancellation fee.</p>
    <p><strong>(ii) Subscriptions of more than one-month</strong> If you terminate a Subscription to ZzukBot within 30 days of the date on which the Subscription became effective or was renewed, no refunds will be provided, and you must pay for the initial 30 days of the Subscription, but no payments will be due for the remaining portion of the terminated Subscription. If you terminate a Subscription to ZzukBot at any other time during the term, you must pay for the remainder of the Term, and no refunds will be provided.</p>
    <p><strong>(iii) Limited Offerings</strong> ZzukBot may terminate your Subscription to a Limited Offering at any time during the Term immediately without notice.</p>
    <p><strong>(iv) Other Subscriptions.</strong> For all other Subscriptions, if you terminate a Subscription before the end of the Term, you must pay a fee equal to one-month's Subscription fee and you will receive a refund of any portion of the Subscription fee you have paid for the remainder of the Term; provided, however, no refunds will be provided for partially unused months.</p>
    <p><strong>c. Suspension.</strong> We may suspend your use of the Online Services if: (1)&nbsp;it is reasonably needed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data; (2)&nbsp;you fail to respond to a claim of alleged infringement under Section&nbsp;5 within a reasonable time; (3)&nbsp;you do not pay amounts due under this agreement; (4)&nbsp;you do not abide by the Acceptable Use Policy or you violate other terms of this agreement; or (5) for Limited Offerings, the Subscription becomes inactive from your failure to access the Online Services as described in the Offer Details. If one or more of these conditions occurs, then:</p>
    <p><strong>(i)</strong> For Limited Offerings, we may suspend your use of the Online Services, your Subscription and your account immediately without notice.</p>
    <p><strong>(ii)</strong> For all other Subscriptions, a suspension will apply to the minimum necessary part of the Online Services and will be in effect only while the condition or need exists. We will give notice before we suspend, except where we reasonably believe we need to suspend immediately. We will give at least 30 days' notice before suspending for non-payment. If you do not fully address the reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate your Subscription and delete your Customer Data without any retention period. We may also terminate your Subscription if your use of the Online Services is suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.</p>

    <p><strong>a. Defense.</strong></p>
